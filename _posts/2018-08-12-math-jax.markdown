## Introduction

This post will describe how to use MathJax to generate $$x^2$$ and $$\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{Z} \mathbf{P^\mathsf{T}}$$

and

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

### MathJax setup.

* I followed the steps from [Dason][jekyll-mathjax] on his blog and also [here][gaston].  Although I had to use default.html rather than the page.html.
