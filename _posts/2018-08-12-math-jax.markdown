## Introduction

This post will describe how to use MathJax to generate $$x^2$$ and $$\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{Z} \mathbf{P^\mathsf{T}}$$

and

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

### MathJax setup.

* I followed the steps from [Dason][jekyll-mathjax] on his blog and also [here][gaston].  Although I had to use default.html rather than the page.html.

This was overly fiddly to setup (seems par for the course, based on other comments), e.g. the maths rendering worked when I served locally, however when I merged to GitHub, the maths wasnâ€™t rendered.  Turns out one had to use `https` instead of `http` in the website included in the `default.html` file.

So this seems to now work (if you can see something below, then it has worked):
