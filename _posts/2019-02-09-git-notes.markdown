Some notes, predominantly so I can remember, of how to use github from the command line.

### New repository

To create a new repository:

``` bash
git init
```
### Clone repository

To clone an existing remote repository:

``` bash
git clone <full repository path>
```
### Add

Add a specific change:

``` bash
git add <filename>
```
Add all changes:

``` bash
git add *
```
### Commit

To commit changes:

``` bash
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

The file is commited to HEAD, but not to the remote repository.

### Pushing

To push changes from HEAD to the remote repository:

``` bash
git push origin master
```

### Updating

To fetch and merge remote changes (i.e. updating your local repository):

``` bash
git pull
```

Git auto-merges changes, which won't necessarily be possibly if there any conficts.  You'll be required to manually resolve (edit) files in the case of conficts.

An alternative to pull, is to use fetch.

``` bash
git fetch
```
